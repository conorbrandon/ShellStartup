# Shell Startup Script

This is a silly little program I wrote that I have set to run when `zsh` is started on my computer. It does nothing useful apart from displaying some pretty ASCII art, tell you the date and time, and list your current working directory and the output of the `ls` command if you were to run it.

        </tr>
